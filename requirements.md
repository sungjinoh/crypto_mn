# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves restructuring the existing cryptocurrency backtesting framework to create a more organized, scalable, and maintainable architecture. The current system has three main components (backtesting_framework, binance_futures_data, and market_neutral strategies) that need better separation of concerns and a cleaner structure to support multiple trading strategies and future expansion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a quantitative trader, I want a well-organized project structure, so that I can easily navigate between data management, backtesting engine, and strategy implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is restructured THEN the system SHALL have clear separation between data layer, backtesting engine, and strategy implementations
2. WHEN a new strategy is added THEN the system SHALL support it without requiring changes to the core backtesting framework
3. WHEN accessing different components THEN each module SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular data management system, so that I can easily work with different data sources and formats without affecting the backtesting logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with market data THEN the system SHALL provide a unified interface for accessing klines, funding rates, and other market data
2. WHEN data is requested THEN the system SHALL handle data loading, caching, and preprocessing transparently
3. WHEN new data sources are added THEN the system SHALL support them through a consistent API

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a strategy developer, I want a standardized strategy interface, so that I can implement new trading strategies without worrying about backtesting infrastructure details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing a new strategy THEN the system SHALL provide a clear base class or interface to inherit from
2. WHEN a strategy generates signals THEN the backtesting framework SHALL handle position management, risk controls, and trade execution automatically
3. WHEN strategy parameters need optimization THEN the system SHALL support parameter sweeps and optimization workflows

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want comprehensive backtesting capabilities, so that I can evaluate strategy performance with realistic market conditions and constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running backtests THEN the system SHALL account for transaction costs, slippage, and funding rates
2. WHEN backtests complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed performance metrics, trade logs, and visualizations
3. WHEN comparing strategies THEN the system SHALL provide standardized performance reporting and comparison tools

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want easy configuration and workflow management, so that I can run backtests and analyses with minimal setup and clear documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a new analysis THEN the system SHALL provide clear entry points and example workflows
2. WHEN configuring backtests THEN the system SHALL use consistent configuration patterns across all components
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want proper package structure and dependencies, so that the codebase is easy to maintain, test, and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is restructured THEN each package SHALL have proper __init__.py files and clear import paths
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL support unit testing for individual components
3. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL have clear requirements and setup instructions
